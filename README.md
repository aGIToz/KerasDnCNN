# KerasDnCNN
Keras implementation of DnCNN-S. Originaly as proposed by Zhang et al in the paper [Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser: Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/paper/DnCNN.pdf).
This implementation is only for DnCNN-S (Specified noise level).

# Functionality
- This project is  useful to denoise an image, if the noise level in an image is known or estimated. 

- This project is also useful to know "How to create custom loss, custom data-augmentation flow and custom learning rate scheduler in keras?". I had a hard time figuring it out  myself.

# Requirments
- python 3, keras 2, OpenCV 3 were being used for development.

# Commands
``` shell
$ sudo
