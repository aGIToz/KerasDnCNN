# KerasDnCNN
Keras implementation of DnCNN-S. Originaly as proposed by Zhang et al in the paper [Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser: Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/paper/DnCNN.pdf)
This implementation is only for DnCNN-S (Specified noise level).

# Functionality
1.This project is  useful to denoise an image, if the noise level in an image is known or estimated.
2. This project is also useful to know "How to create custom loss, custom data-augmentation flow and custom learning rate scheduler in keras?". I had a hard time figuring it out  myself.
